# gh-stats

Find out infromation about your git commit history with this one simple tool! (eventually)

### Installation

```
$ git clone git@github.com:Ttibsi/gh-stats.git
$ cd gh_stats
$ pip install .
```

### Usage

Currently the package has no arguments and will only run with `ghstat`. Other features and flags are coming soon


### Rationale

I found myself regularly checking my github account's contribution graph to see how much work I'd been doing throughout the day.

However, I found myself wanting more granular information that I could get at a glance without leaving the terminal.

Thus, `gh-stats` was born
