# gh_stats

Find out infromation about your git commit history with this one simple tool! (eventually)

### Installation

* Clone repo
* `cd gh_stats/src/gh_stats`
* run `./gh_stats.py`

### Rationale

I found myself regularly checking my github account's contribution graph to see how much work I'd been doing throughout the day.
However, I found myself wanting more granular information that I could get at a glance without leaving the terminal
Thus, `gh_stats` was born
